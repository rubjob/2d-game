# Git Convention

### Convention

1. Please don't commit any changes directly into branch `dev`
2. To develop new feature, please create new branch with **meaningful** name  
   Ex. `dev/<feature-name>` or `dev-<feature-name>`
3. When the feature is satisfied, make a **pull request** to branch `dev`

### Pull request cheat sheet

2. Navigate to **`Pull Requests`** tab at the top
3. Click **`Create pull request`** button on the right
4. Make compare changes with **base**: `dev` &#8592; **compare**: `<your-branch-name>`
5. Put fancy title and description
6. Click **`Create pull request`**
